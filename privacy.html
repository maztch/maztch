    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application
        (the “Service”). By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This Service is provided by <strong>[Your Company/Name]</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”).
      If you have any questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:[your-email@example.com]">[your-email@example.com]</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      We only collect the minimum information necessary to provide the Service.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Authentication data (Firebase Authentication):</strong>
        When you log in, Firebase may process identifiers such as your email address (if you use email login),
        a user ID, and basic authentication tokens needed to keep you signed in.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Service data:</strong>
        We do not collect or use personal data beyond what is required to operate the Service and provide its features.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Optional diagnostic data:</strong>
        If enabled, the app/platform may collect limited technical information (e.g., device type, app version, crash logs)
        to help us maintain reliability. If you do not use any analytics or crash reporting, remove this section.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate you and maintain your session</li>
      <li>Provide and operate the Service</li>
      <li>Prevent abuse, fraud, and security issues</li>
      <li>Maintain and improve performance and reliability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Legal bases (where applicable)</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, we process data under one or more of the following legal bases:
      providing the Service (contract), legitimate interests (security and reliability), and compliance with legal obligations.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Sharing of information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information.
      We only share information with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> We use Firebase Authentication to provide login functionality.
        Firebase processes authentication data as a service provider/processor to enable sign-in and account security.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> If required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain authentication-related data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service.
      You may request deletion of your account and associated authentication records, subject to legal requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect information, including using industry-standard security practices.
      However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal information.
      To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:[your-email@example.com]">[your-email@example.com]</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction).
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Firebase may process and store data on servers located in different countries. Where required, appropriate safeguards are used.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
      Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the updated policy.
    </p>
